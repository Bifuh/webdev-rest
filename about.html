                Hey! I'm Maria Gratzia Indacochea Rosado, Gratzia for short, and I'm an international student from Ecuador. Currently, I'm a senior at the University of St. Thomas and I'm majoring in computer science and math.
                I have three cats, and a fun fact about me is that for this project (for some sick and twisted reason) vue was not running for me. Fun, right?

                thrifting, and trying new restaurants.

            <h4 class="heading">Project Overview and Tools/Frameworks Used</h4>
            <p>This project constitutes a single-page application focused on crimes in St. Paul, Minnesota. The initial 
                phase involved constructing a RESTful server that seamlessly interacted with the St. Paul crimes database. 
                To achieve this, we utilized <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>Node.js</span>, <span>Express.js</span>, and implemented straightforward <span>SQL</span> 
                queries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, the development shifted towards the creation of the web application itself, employing <span>JavaScript</span> 
                and <span>Vue.js</span>. Data retrieval was facilitated through three APIs: the custom API developed earlier, the <span>Leaflet</span> 
                API for mapping functionalities, and the <span>Nominatim</span> API for geocoding purposes. The visual aesthetics were 
                enhanced using the <span>Foundation CSS</span> framework in conjunction with our tailored <span>CSS</span> styling to refine the 
                presentation of HTML elements.
            </p>

            <h4 class="heading" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Application Video Demo</h4>
            <p>Here is a short demo of how our application works.</p>
            <video width="640" height="360" controls>

            <h4 class="heading" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Six interesting findings</h4>
            <p>As we played around with our application, we noted the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The available crime data extends only until November 1st, 2023, prompting us to ponder the developments in St. Paul's crime landscape since that date.</li>
                    <li>The earliest available crime data is from August 14th, 2014.</li>
                    <li>During this period, the peak in crime occurrence was observed on May 29, 2020, with a total of 424 recorded incidents on that day.</li>
                    <li>The police department employs twelve different codes to categorize the exact same incident type, namely "Aggravated Assault, Domestic." We wonder what the difference is.</li>
                    <img src="img/funfact1.jpg" alt="screenshot of crime codes" style="width:30rem; height:18rem;">
                    <li>Capitol River, situated at the heart of St. Paul, registered the highest number of crimes among neighborhoods (considering only the 1000 most recent incidents in the database).</li>
                    <li>Summit Hill had the least number of reported crimes (considering only the 1000 most recent incidents in the database).</li>
                </ul>
